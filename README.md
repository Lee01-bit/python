Compound Data Types:

Tuple(tuple):

- these are similiar to list but they are immutable , meaning once they are created there contents cannot be changed.

- e.g coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)

Dictionary(dict):

these are are a collection of key-value pairs and each key must be unique and the values can be any data type.

name and age are the key values and the values that are assigned to it are data that can be of any type

Type Conversion

Implicit Type Conversion:

- Python automatically converts one data type to another when necessary. For example, adding an integer to a float results in a float.

Explicit Type Conversion (Type Casting):

- You can manually convert one data type to another using functions like:
- int()
- float()
- str()
- list()
