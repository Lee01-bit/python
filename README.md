Compound Data Types:

Tuple(tuple):

- these are similiar to list but they are immutable , meaning once they are created there contents cannot be changed.

- e.g coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)

Dictionary(dict):

these are are a collection of key-value pairs and each key must be unique and the values can be any data type.

name and age are the key values and the values that are assigned to it are data that can be of any type

Type Conversion

Implicit Type Conversion:

- Python automatically converts one data type to another when necessary. For example, adding an integer to a float results in a float.

Explicit Type Conversion (Type Casting):

- You can manually convert one data type to another using functions like:
- int()
- float()
- str()
- list()

Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets (16 Ocotber 2024)

list 

- it is an ordered list collection of items that can hold a variety of data types
- they are mutable , meaning that they can change their contents after they are created.

  Key characterisctics:
  - order: items in a list are ordered and indexed , starting from 0
  - mutability: they can be modified by adding, removing or changin elements
  - Heterogeneous: they can contain elements of different data types.
 
  Operations

  - append() - to add items to the end of the list or you can use insert() to add to a specific position.
  - use indexing (e.g. list[0] forthe first item) or slicing (e.g. list[1:3] for a small list)
    

Libraries

what are they ? 
- libraries in pyhton are collections of pre-written code that you import into your projects to extend the functionality of you programs.

Why Use NumPy and pandas?

NumPy: Ideal for numerical computations and working with large arrays and matrices.

pandas: Essential for data analysis and manipulation, especially when dealing with structured data like tables.
